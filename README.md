Title - Rock Paper Scissors
Description - The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it.

ProjectLog[0] - Made the basic logic for the game. Not perfect yet. The score card isn't updating when the game is played. Will be fixing that in the next log.
ProjectLog[1] - Made the UI for the game. Still working on the score board, for some reason, i am not able to update the score card when the player wins or loses. Aiming to complete that soon.
